## Introduction

The manufacturing industry is undergoing a profound transformation due to the integration of digital technologies and information systems. This shift significantly impacts organizational operations, strategies, and decision-making. This literature review aims to explore the evolution of information technology in manufacturing, the current challenges, and the future trends shaping the industry.

---

## Historic Perspective

Historically, manufacturing has evolved through several technological phases, starting with the automation of structured processes. The introduction of information technology into manufacturing has led to reduced product development times, improved quality, and faster responses to market demands. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has further accelerated this trend, pushing for the digitalization of manufacturing systems.

---

## Current Trends

1. **Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg)**: A service-based approach enabled by IoT, allowing for intelligent access to manufacturing resources.
2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI technologies play a key role in optimizing industrial operations and decision-making, particularly in the Industry 4.0 context.
3. **Big Data Analytics**: The integration of big data in manufacturing improves supply chain efficiency and enhances predictive capabilities.

---

## Impact of Information Systems

Information systems have significantly enhanced operational efficiency in manufacturing, especially in material requirements planning (MRP) and inventory control. The initial disruptions caused by these systems eventually lead to significant improvements in organizational performance as businesses adapt.

## Information System and Decision-Making

The relationship between information systems and decision-making in manufacturing is complex. With the increasing demands for global competitiveness, manufacturers need to employ multi-objective decision-making (MODM) methods, supported by advanced information systems to handle conflicting criteria in production strategies and technology selection.

---

## Key Technologies and Trends

1. **Digital Factory Concept**: Integrates tools like computer-aided design (CAD) and product data management (PDM) to push manufacturing efficiency to new levels.
2. **Cloud Manufacturing**: Merged with IoT, CMfg allows intelligent resource utilization and optimization.
3. **Artificial Intelligence**: Revolutionizes predictive maintenance, quality assurance, and real-time monitoring, becoming a cornerstone for future manufacturing systems.
4. **Big Data**: Empowers firms with insights to enhance operational and strategic decisions.

## Future Directions and Research Gaps

Industry 4.0 envisions a future where cyber-physical systems dominate manufacturing. Products will control their own production processes, allowing for mass customization. However, challenges such as understanding the full potential of Digital Twin (DT) technology and addressing gaps in holistic technology adoption need further exploration.

---

## Conclusion

The journey towards digital transformation in manufacturing is complex but promising. The integration of technologies like AI, IoT, and big data is revolutionizing the sector, making operations more efficient and responsive to market demands. Leaders in the manufacturing industry who embrace these innovations are poised to thrive in the future of digital manufacturing.
